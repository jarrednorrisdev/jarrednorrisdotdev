		As a Simulation Developer at Megasets, I played a vital role in the development and rendering of a cutting-edge 
traffic simulation pipeline used to generate various flavours of synthetic data. Leveraging my expertise in Unity 
Engine, I contributed to the creation of a dynamic world environment in which vehicle simulations can be run, 
capturing frames from a diverse range of virtual sensors. This involved harnessing the power of Unity's graphics 
pipeline, animation tools, and ensuring a seamless user experience.

Following my successful tenure as a Simulation Developer, I transitioned into a Web Development role at Megasets. 
In this capacity, I took on the responsibility of coding a customer platform that empowered users to customize their 
own configurations for a diverse range of data sets. This involved creating a site with React, Gatsby and Chakra UI, 
where I bore the responsibilities of implementing the teamâ€™s designs, routing the pages and connecting the front-end to the back-end. As well as also requiring me to build a custom sensor editor with Three.js and a custom map 
view with Leaflet.js
