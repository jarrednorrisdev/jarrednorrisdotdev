            As a Simulation Developer at Megasets, I played a vital role in the
            development and rendering of a cutting-edge traffic simulation
            pipeline used to generate various flavours of synthetic data.
            Leveraging my expertise in Unity Engine, I contributed to the
            creation of a dynamic world environment in which synthetic data can
            be captured through the running of various configurable simulations,
            capturing frame by frame data from a diverse range of virtual
            sensors. This involved harnessing the power of Unity&apos;s graphics
            pipeline to create custom render pipelines that could generate
            visual data, utilizing Unity animation tools to create realistic
            agent behaviour, and ensuring a seamless user experience within our
            tools.

            Following my successful tenure as a Simulation Developer, I
            transitioned into a Web Development role at Megasets. In this
            capacity, I took on the responsibility of coding a customer platform
            that empowered users to customize their own configurations for a
            diverse range of data sets. This involved creating a site with
            React, Gatsby and Chakra UI, where I bore the responsibilities of
            implementing the teamâ€™s designs within an intuitive web app.
            Including, page routing, complex data manipulation, front-end to
            back-end interoperability and much more. Further achievements
            including building a custom sensor editor with Three.js and a custom
            map view with Leaflet.js.

          As an admin and marketing assistant at Robson Analytics, I was
          responsible for managing the company&apos;s social media presence,
          creating engaging content, and developing marketing strategies to
          increase brand awareness. I also assisted with administrative tasks
          such as data entry.
