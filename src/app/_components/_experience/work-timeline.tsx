            As a Simulation Developer at Megasets, I played a vital role in the
            development and rendering of a cutting-edge traffic simulation
            pipeline used to generate various flavours of synthetic data.
            Leveraging my expertise in Unity Engine, I contributed to the
            creation of a dynamic world environment in which vehicle simulations
            can be run, capturing frames from a diverse range of virtual
            sensors. This involved harnessing the power of Unity's graphics
            pipeline, animation tools, and ensuring a seamless user experience.

            Following my successful tenure as a Simulation Developer, I
            transitioned into a Web Development role at Megasets. In this
            capacity, I took on the responsibility of coding a customer platform
            that empowered users to customize their own configurations for a
            diverse range of data sets. This involved creating a site with
            React, Gatsby and Chakra UI, where I bore the responsibilities of
            implementing the teamâ€™s designs, routing the pages and connecting
            the front-end to the back-end. As well as also requiring me to build
            a custom sensor editor with Three.js and a custom map view with
            Leaflet.js
